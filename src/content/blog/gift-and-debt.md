Like the birthday cake, where the giftedness of our being is honored, an acknowledgement of being. Like the world given by our parents, we are inherently in debt for this being – not necessarily a burdensome obligation, but a condition inherent in the givenness of relation. Navigating the complexities of this debt, especially when faced with an ambivalent ethos that struggles with holding "nos and yesses," of our affirmation or negative affirmations, can make it challenging to find a clear way to reciprocate and respond to this fundamental gift.

Rituals like the birthday cake, with its candles lit in a ritualistic affirmation of being, are ancient rituals of recognizing the giftedness of life. They are a celebration of our sheer that-it-is, connecting to the deep gratitude and debt we feel for being given the world. However, our incapacity to master this given world (T¹), our struggle to answer back to its fundamental conditions, and the failure of our strivings (conatus essendi) to achieve our idealized image ("our ethos high in the sky") faced with a devalued ethos out there.

This very debt to being often fuels the ego, driving our conatus forward compulsively, attempting to discharge this debt through self-determination and mastery. Yet, in the passio essendi, the receptive patience of being, we are called not just to the inherent ambiguity of the world (T¹) but to face the ambiguity of ourselves, confronting our own entanglement with nothingness that underlies our finite existence (the "Return to Zero"). Our vulnerability to ourselves mirrors our vulnerability to the world – when we shed the defenses of the egoistic conatus, we are exposed in our nakedness.

It is from this place of nakedness and vulnerability that genuine openness to being arises. Compassion, born from this openness to suffering (our own and others'), is an affirmation of suffering through acknowledgement. It is the only way to peace in the face of ambiguity and hardship – the moment when our internal obstacles (egoistic defenses, false certainties) are removed. We "passare," we undergo, allowing the experience to move through us, rather than resisting it. Fundamentally it means surrender that leads to liberation and peace. The love and homecoming in relation to God, in relation to us being to ourselves, in love with ourselves. The most profound act if self love being born out of surrender. And yet this love transcends us because it loves being in its most fundamental primal way which can escape us. But to arrive there is to undergo healing. 

For all our being is stretched over a continuum, like points on a disc, constantly in flux. To truly inhabit this dynamic state, to become the whole disc (or rather, the whole of ourselves in relation to the whole of the universe), requires acquiring the finesse to occupy it – a mindful capacity to navigate its complexities without collapsing into reductive certainty. We move from a fixed "point" on the disc to its "radial new dimension" (the hyperbolic), where we dissolve into the whole of ourselves and the whole of the universe.
