# Welcome to My Blog

I'm excited to introduce the new blog section of my portfolio! This marks an important milestone in my journey as a designer and developer.

## What to Expect

In this space, I'll be sharing:

- **Design insights** from my work on various projects
- **Technical deep-dives** into interesting problems and solutions
- **Process documentation** showing how projects evolve from concept to completion
- **Thoughts on the industry** and where it's heading

## The Technology Behind This Blog

This blog is powered by a unique setup that combines:

- **Obsidian vault** for writing and note-taking
- **Git submodules** for content synchronization
- **Next.js** for rendering and performance
- **Markdown processing** with support for [[wikilinks]] and more

This allows me to write in my preferred environment (Obsidian) while maintaining full control over the presentation and SEO optimization.

## A Personal Note

Writing has always been an important part of my creative process, but I've often kept those thoughts private. With this new platform, I'm excited to share more of the thinking and process behind the work.

Whether you're a fellow designer, developer, or simply curious about the creative process, I hope you'll find something valuable here.
