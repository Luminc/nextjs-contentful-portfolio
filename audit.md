Website Audit Report

  Based on my comprehensive analysis, here are the key findings and improvement opportunities:

  ‚úÖ Strengths

  Technical Architecture:
  - Modern Next.js 14 with App Router
  - Well-structured Contentful CMS integration
  - Responsive design with Bootstrap + custom SCSS
  - TypeScript implementation
  - Clean component architecture

  Design & User Experience:
  - Beautiful, minimalist portfolio design
  - Excellent typography with Commissioner font
  - Responsive 3>2>1 column layout for projects
  - Smooth image carousels and navigation
  - Professional artist portfolio presentation

  üîç Improvement Opportunities

  1. Performance Optimizations

  Image Loading:
  - Add loading="lazy" to non-critical images (especially in project documentation sections)
  - Consider using Next.js <Image> placeholder for better loading experience
  - Implement webp format for better compression

  API Calls:
  - Multiple components fetch pages data independently (Header, Footer) - could use context or caching
  - Consider implementing SWR or React Query for better data management

  2. Code Quality & Maintainability

  Duplicate Code:
  - Identical SCSS files in both src/scss/ and src/app/scss/ directories
  - createImageUrl function repeated across multiple components
  - Similar page fetching logic in Header and Footer

  Type Safety:
  - Several any types could be more specific (ContentfulProject, page data)
  - Missing error handling types

  3. User Experience Enhancements

  Navigation:
  - Footer navigation has separators only for first item (line 108-115 in footer)
  - Could add active page highlighting
  - Mobile menu could be improved

  Accessibility:
  - Good alt text coverage, but some images use image.sys.id as alt text
  - Could add skip navigation link
  - Form could use better error states

  Loading States:
  - Simple "Loading..." text could be more engaging
  - No error states for failed API calls

  4. SEO & Metadata

  Missing Elements:
  - No sitemap generation
  - Could add structured data for artwork/portfolio
  - Social media meta tags could be enhanced

  5. Content Management

  Flexibility:
  - Hard-coded "Recent Projects" limit (3 items)
  - No easy way to reorder or feature specific projects
  - About page structure is somewhat rigid

  üöÄ Recommended Priority Improvements

  High Priority:

  1. Consolidate SCSS files - Remove duplicate directories
  2. Create shared utilities - Extract createImageUrl and page fetching logic
  3. Add proper loading states - Replace basic "Loading..." with skeleton screens
  4. Fix footer navigation separators - Ensure consistent formatting

  Medium Priority:

  1. Implement image lazy loading for better performance
  2. Add proper TypeScript interfaces for Contentful data
  3. Create shared data context for pages to avoid duplicate API calls
  4. Enhance error handling throughout the application

  Low Priority:

  1. Add SEO enhancements (sitemap, structured data)
  2. Improve accessibility with skip links and better focus management
  3. Add animation/transition libraries for smoother interactions
  4. Consider adding search functionality for projects

  üí° Possibilities & Future Enhancements

  - Blog/News section integration with Contentful
  - Project filtering/categorization by medium, year, etc.
  - Dark mode toggle (already has light design foundation)
  - Image zoom/lightbox functionality for project galleries
  - Contact form validation and better UX
  - Artist statement or CV page integration
  - Exhibition/show listings from Contentful
  - Multi-language support if needed internationally
